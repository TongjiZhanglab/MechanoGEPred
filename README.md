# MechanoGEPred
This repository contains a trained machine learning model that predicts the elastic modulus of cells based on mechanosensitive genes expression. The model was trained using gradient boosting algorithm and is stored in a joblib format for easy deployment.

## Dependencies
To run the model, you will need install Python 3.11.10 and the following libraries:

scikit-learn(1.5.2)

scipy(1.14.1)

joblib(1.4.2)

numpy(2.0.2)

pandas(2.2.3)

## Usage
The detailed usage can be found in the example file: predict_example.ipynb.
